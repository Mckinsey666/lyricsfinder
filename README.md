# lyricsfinder

A desktop application for lazy people who don't want to open a browser to download lyrics.

```
You can install required packages using *pip*:
```
pip install bs4
```
Check the installed packages by typing:

For the **tkinter** module, first open a python shell and check its version by typing:
```
import tkinter
print(tkinter.TkVersion)
```
